# HOWTO: Add a README.md in a package

## Introduction

Each package should have a README to explain all the details related to a given package at `docs/README.md` path.

In order to help developers, this file is intended to be auto-generated by the `elastic-package build` command.
The template used to generate the final README must be located at `_dev/build/docs/README.md`.
This is the file that developers should be writting/updating.

As a note, there could be more than one readme file present in `_dev/build/docs/*.md`.
`elastic-package build` command will render and write all those files into `docs/` folder.

# Markdown templates

Files in `_dev/build/docs/*.md` follow Markdown syntax and they are rendered using [text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) package.
In addition to Markdown syntax, there are some additional placeholders that can be used in order to help
to complete the information shown to the user.

## Placeholders

List of placeholders that can be used in the Markdown templates:

- `event <data_stream>`: this placeholder is replaced by the contents of the given sample event from the data stream set as parameter.
    - Example of usage:
      ```
      {{ event "metrics" }}
      ```
    - This placeholder looks for the following path `data_stream/metrics/sample_event.json` in the package.
      The contents of that file will be written in the `docs/README.md` where the placeholder is.
    - Example of the rendered output:
      ````
      An example event for `metrics` looks as following:

      ```json
      {
          "@timestamp": "2022-07-28T09:54:47.993Z",
          "agent": {
              "ephemeral_id": "fb0962b4-3f3f-48d6-81d6-3df63366f744",
              "id": "97cba3e2-ea7d-4d80-aa69-75752faa1576",
              "name": "docker-fleet-agent",
              "type": "metricbeat",
              "version": "8.0.0"
          },
          "data_stream": {
              "dataset": "elastic_package_registry.metrics",
              "namespace": "ep",
              "type": "metrics"
          },
          "ecs": {
              "version": "8.3.1"
          },
          "event": {...},
          "host": {...},
          "metricset": {
              "name": "collector",
              "period": 300000
          },
          "package_registry": {...},
          "service": {...}
       }
       ```
       ````
- `fields <data_stream>`: this placeholder is replaced by the contents of the fields of the data stream set as parameter.
    - Example of usage:
      ```
      {{ fields "metrics" }}
      ```
    - This placeholder looks for the following folder `data_stream/metrics/fields/` in the package.
      This folder must contain all the field definitions for this package. `elastic-package build` command reads
      all these files and writes into the final readme (`docs/README.md`) a table with all their information.
    - Example of the rendered output:
      ```
      **Exported fields**

      | Field | Description | Type | Unit | Metric Type |
      |---|---|---|---|---|
      | @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |  |  |
      | data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |  |  |
      | data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |  |  |
      | data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |  |  |
      ...
      ```
