# HOWTO: Writing system tests for a package

## Introduction
Elastic Packages are comprised of data streams. A system test exercises the end-to-end flow of data for a package's data stream â€” from ingesting data from the package's integration service all the way to indexing it into an Elasticsearch data stream.

## Conceptual process

Conceptually, running a system test involves the following steps:

1. Deploy the Elastic Stack, including Elasticsearch, Kibana, and the Elastic Agent. This step takes time so it should typically be done once as a pre-requisite to running system tests on multiple data streams.
1. Enroll the Elastic Agent with Fleet (running in the Kibana instance). This step also can be done once, as a pre-requisite.
1. Depending on the Elastic Package whose data stream is being tested, deploy an instance of the package's integration service.
1. Create a test policy that configures a single data stream for a single package.
1. Assign the test policy to the enrolled Agent.
1. Wait a reasonable amount of time for the Agent to collect data from the integration service and index it into the correct Elasticsearch data stream.
1. Delete test artifacts and tear down the instance of the package's integration service.
1. Once all desired data streams have been system tested, tear down the Elastic Stack.

## Limitations

At the moment system tests have limitations. The salient ones are:
* They can only test packages whose integration services can be deployed via Docker Compose. Eventually they will be able to test packages that can be deployed via other means, e.g. a Terraform configuration.
* They can only check for the _existence_ of data in the correct Elasticsearch data stream. Eventually they will be able to test the shape and contents of the indexed data as well.

## Defining a system test

Packages have a specific folder structure (only relevant parts shown).

```
<package root>/
  data_stream/
    <data stream>/
      manifest.yml
  manifest.yml
```

To define a system test we must define configuration at two levels: the package level and each dataset's level.

### Package-level configuration

First, we must define the configuration for deploying a package's integration service. As mentioned in the [_Limitations_](#Limitations) section above, only packages whose integration services can be deployed via Docker Compose are supported at the moment.

```
<package root>/
  _dev/
    deploy/
      docker/
        docker-compose.yml
```

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the integration service(s) for the package. If your package has a logs data stream, the log files from your package's integration service must be written to a volume. For example, the `apache` package has the following definition in it's integration service's `docker-compose.yml` file.

```
version: '2.3'
services:
  apache:
    # Other properties such as build, ports, etc.
    volumes:
      - ${SERVICE_LOGS_DIR}:/usr/local/apache2/logs
```

Here, `SERVICE_LOGS_DIR` is a special keyword. It is something that we will need later.

### Dataset-level configuration

Next, we must define configuration for each data stream that we want to system test.

```
<package root>/
  data_stream/
    <data stream>/
      _dev/
        test/
          system/
            config.yml
```

The `config.yml` file allows you define values for package and data stream-level variables. For example, the `apache/access` data stream's `config.yml` is shown below.

```
vars: ~
data_stream:
  vars:
    paths:
      - "{{SERVICE_LOGS_DIR}}/access.log*"
```

The top-level `vars` field corresponds to package-level variables defined in the `apache` package's `manifest.yml` file. In the above example we don't override any of these package-level variables, so their default values, as specified in the `apache` package's `manifest.yml` file are used.

The `data_stream.vars` field corresponds to data stream-level variables for the current data stream (`apache/access` in the above example). In the above example we override the `paths` variable. All other variables are populated with their default values, as specified in the `apache/access` data stream's `manifest.yml` file.

Notice the use of the `{{SERVICE_LOGS_DIR}}` placeholder. This corresponds to the `${SERVICE_LOGS_DIR}` variable we saw in the `docker-compose.yml` file earlier. In the above example, the net effect is as if the `/usr/local/apache2/logs/access.log*` files located inside the Apache integration service container become available at the same path from Elastic Agent's perspective.

#### Placeholders

The `SERVICE_LOGS_DIR` placeholder is not the only one available for use in a data stream's `config.yml` file. The complete list of available placeholders is shown below.

| Placeholder name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Hostname`| string | Addressable host name of the integration service. |
| `Ports` | []int | Array of addressable ports the integration service is listening on. |
| `Port` | int | Alias for `Ports[0]`. Provided as a convenience. |
| `Logs.Folder.Agent` | string | Path to integration service's logs folder, as addressable by the Agent. |
| `SERVICE_LOGS_DIR` | string | Alias for `Logs.Folder.Agent`. Provided as a convenience. |

Placeholders used in the `config.yml` must be enclosed in `{{` and `}}` delimiters, per Handlebars syntax.

## Running a system test

Once the two levels of configurations are defined as described in the previous section, you are ready to run system tests for a package's data streams.

First you must deploy the Elastic Stack. This corresponds to steps 1 and 2 as described in the [_Conceptual process_](#Conceptual_process) section.

```
elastic-package stack up -d
```

For a complete listing of options available for this command, run `elastic-package stack up -h` or `elastic-package help stack up`.

Next, you must set environment variables needed for further `elastic-package` commands.

```
$(elastic-package stack shellinit)
```

Next, you must invoke the system tests runner. This corresponds to steps 3 through 7 as described in the [_Conceptual process_](#Conceptual_process) section.

If you want to run system tests for **all data streams** in a package, navigate to the package's root folder (or any sub-folder under it) and run the following command.

```
elastic-package test system
```

If you want to run system tests for **specific data streams** in a package, navigate to the package's root folder (or any sub-folder under it) and run the following command.

```
elastic-package test system --data-streams <data stream 1>[,<data stream 2>,...]
```

Finally, when you are done running all system tests, bring down the Elastic Stack. This corresponds to step 8 as described in the [_Conceptual process_](#Conceptual_process) section.

```
elastic-package stack down
```
