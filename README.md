# elastic-package

`elastic-package` is a command line tool, written in Go, used for developing Elastic packages. It can help you lint, format, 
test, build, and promote your packages. Learn about each of these and other features in [_Commands_](#commands) below.

Currently, `elastic-package` only supports packages of type [Elastic Integrations](https://github.com/elastic/integrations).

## Getting started

Download and build the latest master of `elastic-package` binary:

```bash
go get github.com/elastic/elastic-package
```

Change directory to the package under development. Note: an integration is a specific type of a package.

```bash
cd integrations
cd package/my-package
```

Run the `help` command and see available commands:

```bash
elastic-package help
```

## Commands

`elastic-package` current offers the commands listed below. 

Some commands have a global context, meaning that they can be run from anywhere and they will have the 
same result. Other commands have a package context; these must be run from anywhere under a package's
root folder and they will operate on the contents of that package.

For more details on a specific command, run `elastic-package help <command>`.

### `elastic-package help`

Use this command to get a listing of all commands available under `elastic-package` and a brief
description of what each command does.

_Context: global_

### `elastic-package version`

Use this command to print the version of `elastic-package` that you have installed. This is
especially useful when reporting bugs.

_Context: global_

### `elastic-package build`

Use this command to build a package. TODO: what is the purpose of building a package â€” when would
a package developer want/need to run this command?

_Context: package_

### `elastic-package lint`

Use this command to validate the contents of a package.

_Context: package_

### `elastic-package format`

Use this command to format the contents of a package.

_Context: package_

### `elastic-package check`

Use this command to run the `format`, `lint`, and `build` all at once, in that order.

_Context: package_

### `elastic-package stack`

Use this command to spin up a Docker-based Elastic Stack consisting of Elasticsearch, Kibana, and 
the Package Registry.

_Context: global_

### `elastic-package promote`

_Context: package_

#### GitHub authorization

The `promote` command requires access to the GitHub API to open pull requests or check authorized account data.
The tool uses the GitHub token to authorize user's call to API. The token can be stored in the `~/.elastic/github.token`
file or passed via the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

Here are the instructions on how to create your own personal access token (PAT):
https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token

Make sure you have access to public repositories (to open pull requests) and to user data (check authorized account data).

## Development

Even though the project is "go-gettable", there is the `Makefile` present, which can be used to build, format or vendor
source code:

`make build` - build the tool source

`make format` - format the Go code

`make vendor` - vendor code of dependencies

`make check` - one-liner, used by CI to verify if source code is ready to be pushed to the repository
