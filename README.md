# elastic-package

The elastic-package is a command line tool, written in Go, used for developing Elastic packages.

*For experimental use only*

## Features

TODO

## Supported package types

* [Elastic Integrations](https://github.com/elastic/integrations)

## Getting started

Download and build the latest master of `elastic-package` binary:

```bash
go get github.com/elastic/elastic-package
```

Change directory to the package under development. Note: an integration is a specific type of a package.

```bash
cd integrations
cd package/my-integration
```

Run the `help` command and see available actions:

```bash
elastic-package help
```

## GitHub Authorization

The `promote` subcommand requires access to the GitHub API to open pull requests or check authorized account data.
The tool uses the GitHub token to authorize user's call to API. The token can be stored in the `~/.elastic/github.token`
file or passed via the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

Here are the instructions on how to create your own personal access token (PAT):
https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token

Make sure you have access to public repositories (to open pull requests) and to user data (check authorized account data).

## Development

Even though the project is "go-gettable", there is the `Makefile` present, which can be used to build, format or vendor
source code:

`make build` - build the tool source

`make format` - format the Go code

`make vendor` - vendor code of dependencies

`make check` - one-liner, used by CI to verify if source code is ready to be pushed to the repository
