If you have already defined the attributes globally, then you can only specify the name in this yaml config. If you want to override any specific attribute for a specific bucket, then, you can define it here. Any attribute defined in the yaml will override the global definitions. Please see the relevant [Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/8.5/filebeat-input-gcs.html#attrib-buckets) for further information.
