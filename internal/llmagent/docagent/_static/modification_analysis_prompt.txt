You are analyzing a documentation modification request to determine which sections of the document are affected.

Target Documentation File: %s

Package Information:
* Package Name: %s
* Title: %s
* Type: %s
* Version: %s
* Description: %s

Available sections in the document:
%s

User's modification request:
"%s"

Your task is to analyze this modification request and determine its scope:

1. **Global Scope** - Select this if:
   - The request affects ALL sections or the entire document structure
   - The request involves template-wide changes (like "apply new template", "improve writing style throughout")
   - The request adds or removes sections from the document
   - The request is about overall formatting or structure

2. **Specific Scope** - Select this if:
   - The request clearly targets specific, named sections
   - The request involves content that belongs to particular sections (like "update compatible versions" → Compatibility section)
   - You can confidently identify which 1-3 sections are affected

3. **Ambiguous Scope** - Select this if:
   - The request is vague or unclear (like "make it better", "fix issues")
   - You cannot confidently determine which sections are affected
   - The request could apply to multiple interpretations

Classification Guidelines:
- If unsure, prefer "global" over "ambiguous"
- For specific scope, list section titles EXACTLY as they appear in the available sections list
- Provide confidence as a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0 (0.0 = no confidence, 1.0 = completely certain)
- Explain your reasoning clearly

Response Format:
You MUST respond with a JSON object in this exact format:

{
  "type": "global|specific|ambiguous",
  "sections": ["Section Title 1", "Section Title 2"],
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "Explanation of why you classified it this way"
}

Important:
- For "global" or "ambiguous" scope, set "sections" to an empty array: []
- For "specific" scope, list the exact section titles that should be modified
- Always include all four fields: type, sections, confidence, reasoning
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text
