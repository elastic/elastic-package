You previously hit token limits when generating documentation. Let's break this into manageable sections.

CURRENT TASK: Generate %s documentation section by section for the integration below.

Target Documentation File: %s

Package Information:
* Package Name: %s
* Title: %s
* Type: %s
* Version: %s
* Description: %s

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Section-Based Approach**: Instead of generating the entire README at once, we'll build it section by section.

2. **Current Strategy**:
   - First, use get_readme_template to understand the required structure
   - Then generate ONLY the first major section (Overview/Introduction)
   - Write that section to the file
   - In subsequent iterations, we'll add more sections

3. **First Section Focus**:
   - Start with the Overview/Introduction section only
   - Include: Brief description, compatibility info, and how it works
   - Keep this section under 1000 words to avoid token limits

4. **Available Tools**:
   - get_readme_template: Get the template structure (follows README.md format)
   - get_example_readme: Get style reference
   - list_directory, read_file: Analyze package
   - write_file: Write the section to _dev/build/docs/%s

5. **File Strategy**:
   - Read existing documentation file (if any) to preserve human-edited sections
   - Write the first section, preserving any existing content
   - Later iterations will append additional sections

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:
1. Get the template structure using get_readme_template
2. Read current _dev/build/docs/%s (if exists) to understand what's already there
3. Analyze package structure briefly using list_directory
4. Generate ONLY the Overview/Introduction section
5. Write this section to the documentation file

Begin by getting the template, then focus on creating just the first section.
