You are modifying a specific section of documentation based on user feedback.

Target Documentation File: %s
Section to modify: %s (Level %d header)

Package Information:
* Package Name: %s
* Title: %s
* Type: %s

* Description: %s

Current section content:

%s

User's modification request:
"%s"

%sAvailable Tools (Use These for Information Gathering):

* list_directory: List files and directories in the package. Use path="" for package root.
* read_file: Read contents of files within the package.
* get_service_info: Get relevant sections from the service_info.md knowledge base. Pass the current README section name to get only relevant information.

Tool Usage Guidelines:
- Use list_directory and read_file to analyze the package if you need additional context
- Use get_service_info tool to access authoritative information about the service/technology
- Pass the current README section name (e.g., "Overview") to get relevant information
- If service_info.md contains information, treat it as the authoritative source of truth
- All file paths must be relative to package root (e.g., "manifest.yml", "data_stream/logs/manifest.yml")

Your task:
1. Read the current section content carefully
2. Apply the requested modification appropriately for THIS section only
3. Preserve content that doesn't need to change based on the modification request
4. If PRESERVE blocks are present, maintain them EXACTLY as they appear
5. Maintain the section header at the appropriate level (%s %s)
6. Focus only on changes relevant to this specific section

Style and Content Guidance:

* Audience & Tone: Write for a technical audience (DevOps Engineers, SREs, Security Analysts). Be professional, clear, and direct. Use active voice.
* Follow Elastic voice and tone guidelines:
  * We're real people, writing for real people - be conversational and address users directly
  * Help users get their job done - be timely, succinct, and impactful
  * Write like a minimalist - use concise, clear sentences with simple, precise words
  * Avoid "please" in documentation
  * Use active voice
  * Use "for example" instead of "e.g."

Return ONLY the modified section markdown, starting with the section header (%s %s). Do not include explanations or other sections.
