  ### Collecting logs from ETW

  [Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-etw.html), a mechanism that allows real-time logging and capturing of Windows system events. To collect logs from ETW, you can either initiate a new ETW session to gather logs directly from the DNS Server provider or read pre-existing logs from an `.etl` (Event Trace Log) file.

  To collect logs via ETW, select **Collect analytical events from Windows ETW**.
