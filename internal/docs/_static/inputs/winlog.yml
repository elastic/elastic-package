  ### Collecting logs from Winlog

  You can use the `winlog` input package for Elastic to collect Windows event logs. It uses Windows APIs to read events from various logs, such as Application, Security, and System.

  To collect logs via Winlog, select **Collect logs via Winlog** and configure the following parameter:

  - Event IDs: A list of included and excluded (blocked) event IDs. The value is a comma-separated list. The accepted values are single event IDs to include (for example, 4624), a range of event IDs to include (for example, 4700-4800), and single event IDs to exclude (for example, -4735). Limit 22 IDs.
