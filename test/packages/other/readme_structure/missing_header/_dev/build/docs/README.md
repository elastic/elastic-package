# Test Integration

## Overview

This is a test integration.

### Compatibility

Compatible with Linux, Windows, macOS, and imaginary systems.

## What data does this integration collect?

This integration collects basic event logs, dummy metrics, and simulated user actions.

### Supported use cases

- Testing pipeline connectivity  
- Simulating event ingestion  
- Dummy dashboard population

## What do I need to use this integration?

- A running instance of the test agent  
- Dummy API credentials (username: `test`, password: `dummy`)  
- Optional: a container or VM to simulate load

## How do I deploy this integration?

1. Install the test integration package.  
2. Configure the dummy data source.  
3. Enable the integration via the dashboard.  
4. Verify events are received.

## Troubleshooting

- If no data is shown, ensure the dummy service is running.  
- Check logs at `/var/log/dummy.log` for errors.  
- Restart the test agent if needed.

## Performance and scaling

This integration is lightweight and scales linearly with event volume.  
For high-load testing, deploy across multiple nodes.
