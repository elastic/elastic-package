# Apache Integration

This integration periodically fetches metrics from [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) servers. It can parse access and error
logs created by the Apache server.

## Compatibility

The Apache datasets were tested with Apache 2.4.12 and 2.4.20 and are expected to work with
all versions >= 2.2.31 and >= 2.4.16.
