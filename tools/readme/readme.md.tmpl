# elastic-package

`elastic-package` is a command line tool, written in Go, used for developing Elastic packages. It can help you lint, format,
test, build, and promote your packages. Learn about each of these and other features in [_Commands_](#commands) below.

Currently, `elastic-package` only supports packages of type [Elastic Integrations](https://github.com/elastic/integrations).

## Getting started

Download latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package/releases/latest) page.

On macOS, use `xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine elastic-package` after downloading to allow the binary to run.

Alternatively, you may use `go install` but you will not be able to use the `elastic-package version` command or check updates.

```bash
go install github.com/elastic/elastic-package@latest
```

_Please make sure that you've correctly [setup environment variables](https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code.html#GOPATH) -
`$GOPATH` and `$PATH`, and `elastic-package` is accessible from your `$PATH`._

Change directory to the package under development.

```bash
cd my-package
```

Run the `help` command and see available commands:

```bash
elastic-package help
```

## Development

Download and build the latest main of `elastic-package` binary:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package.git
make build
```

## Commands

`elastic-package` currently offers the commands listed below.

Some commands have a _global context_, meaning that they can be executed from anywhere and they will have the
same result. Other commands have a _package context_; these must be executed from somewhere under a package's
root folder and they will operate on the contents of that package.

For more details on a specific command, run `elastic-package help <command>`.

### `elastic-package help`

_Context: global_

Use this command to get a listing of all commands available under `elastic-package` and a brief
description of what each command does.

### `elastic-package completion`

_Context: global_

Use this command to output shell completion information.

The command output shell completions information (for `bash`, `zsh`, `fish` and `powershell`). The output can be sourced in the shell to enable command completion.

Run `elastic-package completion` and follow the instruction for your shell.

### GitHub authorization

The `promote` and `publish` commands require access to the GitHub API to open pull requests or check authorized account data.
The tool uses the GitHub token to authorize user's call to API. The token can be stored in the `~/.elastic/github.token`
file or passed via the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

Here are the instructions on how to create your own personal access token (PAT):
https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token

Make sure you have enabled the following scopes:
* `public_repo` — to open pull requests on GitHub repositories.
* `read:user` and `user:email` — to read your user profile information from GitHub in order to populate pull requests appropriately.

After creating or modifying your personal access token, authorize the token for
use of the Elastic organization: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on

## Development

Even though the project is "go-gettable", there is the `Makefile` present, which can be used to build, format or vendor
source code:

`make build` - build the tool source

`make format` - format the Go code

`make install` - build the tool source and move binary to `$GOBIN`

`make vendor` - vendor code of dependencies

`make check` - one-liner, used by CI to verify if source code is ready to be pushed to the repository

## Release process

This project uses [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) to release a new version of the application (semver). Release publishing
is automatically managed by the Jenkins CI ([Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package/blob/main/.ci/Jenkinsfile))
and it's triggered by Git tags. Release artifacts are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package/releases) section.

### Steps to create a new release

1. Fetch latest main from upstream (remember to rebase the branch):

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

2. Create Git tag with release candidate:

```bash
git tag v0.15.0 # let's release v0.15.0!
```

3. Push new tag to the upstream.

```bash
git push upstream v0.15.0
```

The CI will run a new job for the just pushed tag and publish released artifacts. Please expect an automated follow-up PR
in the [Integrations](https://github.com/elastic/integrations) repository to bump up the version ([sample PR](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/pull/1516)).
