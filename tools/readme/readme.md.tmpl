# elastic-package

`elastic-package` is a command line tool, written in Go, used for developing Elastic packages. It can help you lint, format,
test and build your packages. Learn about each of these and other features in [_Commands_](#commands) below.

Currently, `elastic-package` only supports packages of type [Elastic Integrations](https://github.com/elastic/integrations).

## Getting started

Download latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package/releases/latest) page.

On macOS, use `xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine elastic-package` after downloading to allow the binary to run.

Alternatively, you may use `go install` but you will not be able to use the `elastic-package version` command or check updates.

```bash
go install github.com/elastic/elastic-package@latest
```

_Please make sure that you've correctly [setup environment variables](https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code.html#GOPATH) -
`$GOPATH` and `$PATH`, and `elastic-package` is accessible from your `$PATH`._

Change directory to the package under development.

```bash
cd my-package
```

Run the `help` command and see available commands:

```bash
elastic-package help
```

## Development

Even though the project is "go-gettable", there is the [`Makefile`](./Makefile) present, which can be used to build,
install, format the source code among others. Some examples of the available targets are:

`make build` - build the tool source

`make clean` - delete elastic-package binary and build folder

`make format` - format the Go code

`make check` - one-liner, used by CI to verify if source code is ready to be pushed to the repository

`make install` - build the tool source and move binary to `$GOBIN`

`make gomod` - ensure go.mod and go.sum are up to date

`make update` - update README.md file

`make licenser` - add the Elastic license header in the source code

To start developing, download and build the latest main of `elastic-package` binary:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package.git
cd elastic-package
make build
```

When developing on Windows, please use the `core.autocrlf=input` or `core.autocrlf=false` option to avoid issues with CRLF line endings:
```bash
git clone --config core.autocrlf=input https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package.git
cd elastic-package
make build
```

This option can be also configured on existing clones with the following commands. Be aware that these commands
will remove uncommited changes.
```bash
git config core.autocrlf input
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard
```

### Testing with integrations repository

While working on a new branch, it is interesting to test these changes
with all the packages defined in the [integrations repository](https://github.com/elastic/integrations).
This allows to test a much wider scenarios than the test packages that are defined in this repository.

This test can be triggered automatically directly from your Pull Request by adding a comment `test integrations`. Example:
- Comment: https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package/pull/1335#issuecomment-1619721861
- Pull Request created in integrations repository: https://github.com/elastic/integrations/pull/6756

This comment triggers this [Buildkite pipeline](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package/blob/6f084e21561105ac9773acab00c3439251f111a0/.buildkite/pipeline.test-with-integrations-repo.yml) ([Buildkite job](https://buildkite.com/elastic/elastic-package-test-with-integrations)).

This pipeline creates a new draft Pull Request in integration updating the required dependencies to test your own changes. As a new pull request is created, a CI
job will be triggered to test all the packages defined in this repository. A new comment with the link to this new Pull Request will be posted in your package-spec Pull Request.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember to close this PR in the integrations repository once you close the package-spec Pull Request.

Usually, this process would require the following manual steps:
1. Create your elastic-package pull request and push all your commits
2. Get the SHA of the latest changeset of your PR:
   ```bash
    $ git show -s --pretty=format:%H
   1131866bcff98c29e2c84bcc1c772fff4307aaca
   ```
3. Go to the integrations repository, and update go.mod and go.sum with that changeset:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/integrations/repostiory
   go mod edit -replace github.com/elastic/elastic-package=github.com/<your_github_user>/elastic-package@1131866bcff98c29e2c84bcc1c772fff4307aaca
   go mod tidy
   ```
4. Push these changes into a branch and create a Pull Request
    - Creating this PR would automatically trigger a new Jenkins pipeline.


### Testing with Elastic serverless

While working on a branch, it might be interesting to test your changes using
a project created in [Elastic serverless](https://docs.elastic.co/serverless), instead of spinning up a local
Elastic stack. To do so, you can add a new comment while developing in your Pull request
a comment like `test serverless`.

Adding that comment in your Pull Request will create a new build of this
[Buildkite pipeline](https://buildkite.com/elastic/elastic-package-test-serverless).
This pipeline creates a new Serverless project and run some tests with the packages defined
in the `test/packages/parallel` folder. Currently, there are some differences with respect to testing
with a local Elastic stack:
- System tests are not executed.
- Disabled comparison of results in pipeline tests to avoid errors related to GeoIP fields
- Pipeline tests cannot be executed with coverage flags.

At the same time, this pipeline is going to be triggered daily to test the latest contents
of the main branch with an Elastic serverless project.


## Commands

`elastic-package` currently offers the commands listed below.

Some commands have a _global context_, meaning that they can be executed from anywhere and they will have the
same result. Other commands have a _package context_; these must be executed from somewhere under a package's
root folder and they will operate on the contents of that package.

For more details on a specific command, run `elastic-package help <command>`.

### `elastic-package help`

_Context: global_

Use this command to get a listing of all commands available under `elastic-package` and a brief
description of what each command does.

### `elastic-package completion`

_Context: global_

Use this command to output shell completion information.

The command output shell completions information (for `bash`, `zsh`, `fish` and `powershell`). The output can be sourced in the shell to enable command completion.

Run `elastic-package completion` and follow the instruction for your shell.

## Elastic Package profiles

The `profiles` subcommand allows to work with different configurations. By default,
`elastic-package` uses the "default" profile. Other profiles can be created with the
`elastic-package profiles create` command. Once a profile is created, it will have its
own directory inside the elastic-package data directory. Once you have more profiles,
you can change the default with `elastic-package profiles use`.

You can find the profiles in your system with `elastic-package profiles list`.

You can delete profiles with `elastic-package profiles delete`.

Each profile can have a `config.yml` file that allows to persist configuration settings
that apply only to commands using this profile. You can find a `config.yml.example` that
you can copy to start.

The following settings are available per profile:

* `stack.apm_enabled` can be set to true to start an APM server and configure instrumentation
  in services managed by elastic-package. Traces for these services are available in the APM
  UI of the kibana instance managed by elastic-package. Supported only by the compose provider.
  Defaults to false.
* `stack.elastic_cloud.host` can be used to override the address when connecting with
  the Elastic Cloud APIs. It defaults to `https://cloud.elastic.co`.
* `stack.geoip_dir` defines a directory with GeoIP databases that can be used by
  Elasticsearch in stacks managed by elastic-package. It is recommended to use
  an absolute path, out of the `.elastic-package` directory.
* `stack.kibana_http2_enabled` can be used to control if HTTP/2 should be used in versions of
  kibana that support it. Defaults to true.
* `stack.logstash_enabled` can be set to true to start Logstash and configure it as the
  default output for tests using elastic-package. Supported only by the compose provider.
  Defaults to false.
* `stack.self_monitor_enabled` enables monitoring and the system package for the default
  policy assigned to the managed Elastic Agent. Defaults to false.
* `stack.serverless.type` selects the type of serverless project to start when using
  the serverless stack provider.
* `stack.serverless.region` can be used to select the region to use when starting
  serverless projects.

## Useful environment variables

There are available some environment variables that could be used to change some of the
`elastic-package` settings:

- Related to `docker-compose` / `docker compose` commands:
    - `ELASTIC_PACKAGE_COMPOSE_DISABLE_VERBOSE_OUTPUT`: If set to `true`, it disables the progress output from `docker compose`/`docker-compose` commands.
        - For versions v2 `< 2.19.0`, it sets `--ansi never` flag.
        - For versions v2 `>= 2.19.0`, it sets `--progress plain` flag and `--quiet-pull` for `up` sub-command`.


- Related to global `elastic-package` settings:
    - `ELASTIC_PACKAGE_CHECK_UPDATE_DISABLED`: if set to `true`, `elastic-package` is not going to check
      for newer versions.
    - `ELASTIC_PACKAGE_PROFILE`: Name of the profile to be using.
    - `ELASTIC_PACKAGE_DATA_HOME`: Custom path to be used for `elastic-package` data directory. By default this is `~/.elastic-package`.

- Related to the build process:
    - `ELASTIC_PACKAGE_REPOSITORY_LICENSE`: Path to the default repository license.
    - `ELASTIC_PACKAGE_LINKS_FILE_PATH`: Path to the links table file (e.g. `links_table.yml`) with the link definitions to be used in the build process of a package.

- Related to signing packages:
    - `ELASTIC_PACKAGE_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEYFILE`: Path to the private key file to sign packages.
    - `ELASTIC_PACKAGE_SIGNER_PASSPHRASE`: Passphrase to use the private key file.

- Related to tests:
    - `ELASTIC_PACKAGE_SERVERLESS_PIPELINE_TEST_DISABLE_COMPARE_RESULTS`: If set to `true`, the results from pipeline tests are not compared to avoid errors from GeoIP.

- To configure the Elastic stack to be used by `elastic-package`:
    - `ELASTIC_PACKAGE_ELASTICSEARCH_HOST`: Host of the elasticsearch (e.g. https://127.0.0.1:9200)
    - `ELASTIC_PACKAGE_ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME`: User name to connect to elasticsearch (e.g. elastic)
    - `ELASTIC_PACKAGE_ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD`: Password of that user.

## Release process

This project uses [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) to release a new version of the application (semver). Release publishing
is automatically managed by the Jenkins CI ([Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package/blob/main/.ci/Jenkinsfile))
and it's triggered by Git tags. Release artifacts are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package/releases) section.

### Steps to create a new release

1. Fetch latest main from upstream (remember to rebase the branch):

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

2. Create Git tag with release candidate:

```bash
git tag v0.15.0 # let's release v0.15.0!
```

3. Push new tag to the upstream.

```bash
git push upstream v0.15.0
```

The CI will run a new job for the just pushed tag and publish released artifacts. Please expect an automated follow-up PR
in the [Integrations](https://github.com/elastic/integrations) repository to bump up the version ([sample PR](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/pull/1516)).
